# Software tutorial in Flatiron Inst. [Dec 2025]

The tutorial has two parallel parts -- C++ and Python. Both projects in their initial and final stages can be found in this repository in corresponding directories. 

## C++

For the `C++` part, we will be closely following the documentation [here](https://haykh.github.io/oh-my-dear-imgui). Make sure to install all the required dependencies as described [here](https://haykh.github.io/oh-my-dear-imgui/install.html).

## Python

For Python, you only need a virtual environment with the installed `dearpygui` package (from the `python/` directory):

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
